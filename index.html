    <p>People often descrbe Kodi as a free spirit who plays by his own rules. He is very friendly around the neighborhood and often brightens people's day. He might be cute but he has the attitude of a top model diva! This doggo loves chasing leaves almost as much as he loves chasing his cat brother Travis. But beware he bamboozles as well as he looks.</p>
